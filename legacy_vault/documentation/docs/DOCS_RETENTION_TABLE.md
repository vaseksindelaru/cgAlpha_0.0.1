# Documentation Retention Table (KEEP / MERGE / ARCHIVE)

## Purpose of Each Category

- `KEEP`: Document is active, authoritative, or frequently used. Keep it where it is.
- `MERGE`: Content is valuable but should be consolidated into canonical docs to reduce fragmentation.
- `ARCHIVE`: Historical reference only after merge is complete. Keep in archive location, not in daily reading flow.

## Current Classification

## Cleanup Rule

Do not move any `MERGE` file to `ARCHIVE` until:
1. Content is consolidated into canonical docs.
2. `docs/DOCS_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` is updated to `FULL`.
3. Core test suite still passes.
